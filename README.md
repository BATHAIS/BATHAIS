### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a United States Marine with 11+ years of service. Originally from Washington D.C. and raised in Northern Virginia.  While active duty I served as an Aircraft firefighter, Embassy Security Guard, and Intelligence Analyst. Currently on SkillBridge with Cybervets pursuing a future career in cybersecurity. I have no background in cybersecurity so I am learning from the ground up. My short term and mid term goals are to successfully complete Cybervets SkillBridge, Google cybersecurity Professional Certificate, CompTia Network+ and CompTia Security+. My passions outside of work include physical activities and spending time with my family.
